# Animal Classifier App

This project is a simple iOS application built with **Swift** and **SwiftUI** to classify images of dogs, cats, and rabbits using a custom CoreML model created with **CreateML**. The app allows users to upload an image from their photo library, and the model predicts whether the image is of a cat, dog, or rabbit.

## Features

- Image upload from the photo library
- Uses CoreML model trained to classify cats, dogs, and rabbits
- Prediction is displayed on-screen after classification
- Clean and modern UI with subtle gradient background


## Tech Stack

- **Swift**: Used for app development
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface
- **CoreML**: For running the machine learning model
- **Vision Framework**: To process the image and make predictions using CoreML

## Requirements

- Xcode 12 or later
- iOS 14 or later
- Swift 5
